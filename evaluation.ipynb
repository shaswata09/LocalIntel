The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0.

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability.

       " \"UI Wiki Document:\\n\\nOpenssl == 1.9.0\\n\\nThe openssl dependency is a fork of OpenSSL to enable QUIC. OpenSSL is toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication. Node.js currently uses the quictls/openssl fork, which closely tracks the main openssl/openssl releases with the addition of APIs to support the QUIC protocol. See maintaining-openssl for more information.\\nFor our faceapp application, OpenSSL version 1.9.0 is used under the hood by the Node.js runtime to provide secure communication capabilities. However, we typically don't interact with OpenSSL directly in our Node.js application code. Instead, Node.js provides built-in modules such as crypto and tls, which utilize OpenSSL internally to provide cryptographic and secure communication features. For example, the crypto module provides cryptographic functionality, such as encryption, decryption, hashing, and digital signature generation and verification. Where as the tls module provides an implementation of the TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocols for secure communication. We use it to create secure servers and clients for handling HTTPS requests, secure WebSocket connections, and more.\\n\\n\\nEvent Simulator Wiki Document:\\n\\nMany users may be familiar with how software is packaged and installed on Linux and other systems using package managers. For example, to install a given Linux development library such as OpenSSL, a package manager is typically used (e.g., apt install openssl libssl-dev), which leads to shared libraries being installed under /usr/ lib/, development headers being installed under /usr/include/, etc. Programs that wish to use these libraries must link the system libraries and include the development headers. TES-3 is capabile of being installed in exactly the same way, and some downstream package maintainers have packaged TES-3 for some systems such as Ubuntu. However, as of this writing, the TES-3 project has not prioritized or standardized such package distribution, favoring instead to recommend a source download without a system-level install. This is mainly because most TES-3 users prefer to slightly or extensively edit or extend the TES-3 libraries, or to build them in specific ways (for debugging, or optimized for large-scale simulation campaign). Our build system provides an install command that can be used to install libraries and headers to system locations (usually requiring administrator privileges), but usually the libraries are just built and used from within the TES-3 build directory.\",\n",

It simplifies the process of connecting to a MongoDB database, performing CRUD operations, and using advanced features like data mapping, query derivation, and more.\\nTo use spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb version 3.3.3 in our resumelink application, we perform the following steps: We first create SpringBoot application, then we define domain model class. After that we create a repository framework. Then we configure MongoDB in application.properties. We then create a service class and controller class.

The framework comprises several components, including LangChain Libraries, which consist of Python and JavaScript libraries containing interfaces, integrations for various components, a basic runtime for combining these components into chains and agents, and pre-built implementations of chains and agents. Furthermore, LangChain offers LangChain Templates, a collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide range of tasks, LangServe, a library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API, and LangSmith, a developer platform that facilitates debugging, testing, evaluation, and monitoring of chains built on any LLM framework while seamlessly integrating with LangChain.\n",

      "For our ChatBot application we utilize LangChain framework. We use Langchain version 0.0.194 for our application. It provides the us platform to adapt language model with flexibility to our specific context. We utilize some of the core components within the langchain to build context-aware language models systems. To achieve this, we use core components including LLM interface, chains, prompt templates, retrieval modules, memory. In case of LLM interface, we interface with proprietary models such as GPT to make API calls. We leverage gpt-3.5-turbo as our base generator model. Chains are the fundamental principle that holds various AI components in LangChain to provide context-aware responses. A chain is a series of automated actions from the user's query to the model's output. Chain in our case implements Program-Aided Language Models (PAL) for generating code solutions. This is utilized to answer math or code related questions in our interface. PALChain reads complex math problems (described in natural language) and generates programs (for solving the math problem) as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter.\n",
